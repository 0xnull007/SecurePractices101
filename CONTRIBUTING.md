# Contributing to SecurePractices101

Welcome to SecurePractices101! We aim to educate and raise awareness about general programming vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and undefined behavior in C/C++ code. If you'd like to contribute to our project, please follow these guidelines:

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

### 1. Reporting Buffer Overflows

If you identify a buffer overflow vulnerability in the code, please create an issue report. Include detailed information about the vulnerability, the code snippet or file where it occurs, and the potential risks involved. Here's an example of how to report a buffer overflow:

**Issue: Buffer Overflow in Function XYZ**

**Description:**
In function XYZ within `file.c`, I've identified a buffer overflow vulnerability that could lead to potential code execution exploits.

**Code Snippet:**
```markdown
void XYZ(char* user_input) {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, user_input);
}
```
**Potential Risks:**
This vulnerability could allow an attacker to overwrite the return address and potentially execute malicious code.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Compile and run the code with a longer user_input.
  2. Observe the behavior when the buffer overflows.

**Expected Behavior:**
Proper handling of buffer overflows to prevent code execution exploits.

**Actual Behavior:**
The buffer overflows and can lead to unexpected results.

### 2. Reporting Undefined Behavior

If you identify instances of undefined behavior in C/C++ code, please create an issue report. Describe the specific scenario, code involved, and the possible consequences of the undefined behavior. Here's an example of how to report undefined behavior:


**Issue: Undefined Behavior in Function ABC**

**Description:**
In function ABC within `file.cpp`, I've identified an instance of undefined behavior involving pointer arithmetic.

**Code Snippet:**
```markdown
int* ptr = nullptr;
int value = *ptr;  // Dereferencing a null pointer.
```
**Possible Consequences:**
Dereferencing a null pointer leads to undefined behavior, which can result in a crash or other unpredictable outcomes.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

  1. Compile and run the code with the provided snippet.
  2. Observe the behavior when dereferencing a null pointer.

**Expected Behavior:**
Proper handling of null pointers to prevent undefined behavior.

**Actual Behavior:**
The code exhibits undefined behavior.


## Code Contributions

While our primary focus is on vulnerability reports, we also welcome code contributions that demonstrate and educate about these vulnerabilities. Please ensure that your code examples are educational and ethical, intended for learning purposes only.

Thank you for contributing to SecurePractices101 and helping others learn about and understand general programming vulnerabilities in C/C++ code.
